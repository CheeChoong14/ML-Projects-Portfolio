## Lab_Linear Regression

This lab enhancement explores the concept of linear regression. It explains the concept of linear regression and its practical applications, demonstrate how to load and analyze real-world datasets, and show how to visualize data points and fit lines with basic linear regression models. The model will also be evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R², Root Meat Square Error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSR). Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso to prevent overfitting will be covered and the models are tested with cross-validation to assess the reliability of model performance.
