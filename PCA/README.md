# Lab_PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data science and machine learning. It simplifies datasets by transforming them into a set of principal components, which capture the most significant variance in the data.

This lab enhancement focuses on exploring PCA using Python. The primary objective is to reduce the dimensionality of a socio-economic dataset while retaining as much information as possible, followed by clustering analysis to derive actionable insights. By working through this lab, you will gain an understanding of PCA's theoretical foundations, learn how to implement it programmatically, and apply it to a real-world dataset. Additionally, this lab demonstrates clustering techniques using K-means to group countries into various stages of development. The notebook also provides hands-on experience with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
