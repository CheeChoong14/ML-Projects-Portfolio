## Machine Learning Projects

## __Overview__
This repository consists of 4 labs that focus on addressing various machine learning problems and explore different types of models, including linear regression, K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Pytorch. Additionally, the 5th folder consist of a project that analyze and predict crime patterns based on collected data. The challenge at hand is approached as a regression problem, where the target variable is the number of crimes reported ("crimes").

## __Compilation Instructions__
1. In your terminal, clone the repository by typing 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Melo04/ML-assignment.git
```
2. After that, type the below command. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
3. In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.
```bash
# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, type the following command in your terminal.
```bash
